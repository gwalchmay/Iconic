This app was made with the React/Node.js/MySQL stack.

The app is called Iconic, and its goal is to catalogue great moments in comics history,
divided in three self-explaining categories: badass, funny and inspirationnal.

Navigating the app is easy: you land on the homepage which presents you with the latests posts.
Links in the sidebar take you to posts sorted by categories, heroes or ages (for an explanation
on Ages of Comic Books, just click the link).

An admin page can be accessed through the '/login' url, but require an admin account (username + password).
The admin page allows the admin to create a new hero, a new post or a new user.

The app is fully responsive.
